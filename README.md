# ⚡ Jeremy — The Business-Backed Tech Architect

**I don’t just write code — I build machines that make businesses bulletproof.**

After 15+ years leading IT operations, architecting telecom infrastructure, and driving innovation across healthcare, SaaS, and service industries, I’ve mastered one truth:

> 🚫 Most tech guys don’t understand business.  
> 🔥 Most business guys don’t understand tech.  
> ✅ I speak both — and I build systems that scale the entire operation.

From serving as **Director of IT** for a neurology hospital network to running **NOC supervision** for telecom firms like Altaworx…  
From launching a **7-figure automation-enabled window tint company** to designing **custom CRM pipelines and failover infrastructure**…  
My approach is simple: **Find the friction. Eliminate it with tech. Build once. Scale forever.**

### 🧭 My Mission
To prove that the right tech + the right mind can 10x a business — even one that thinks it’s already “optimized.” I don’t chase trends. I chase performance.
